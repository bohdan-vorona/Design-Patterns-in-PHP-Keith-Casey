Design Patterns in PHP
======================

This code is designed to accompany the lynda.com video course "Design Patterns in PHP" by Keith Casey. If you've
 received this code without seeing the videos, go watch the videos. It will make way more sense and be more
 useful in general.

# How to Use this Repository

In each of the numbered folders, you will find a few directories. The first folder - called before - is what your code
 might look like before the pattern. While it's not beautiful, it isn't necessarily wrong.. but it can be better. After
 exploring the "before" folder, check out the "after" folder to see what the code might look like after a bit of
 refactoring for the design pattern. This isn't the only possible solution or implementation. It just happens to be
 the one I chose to share.
